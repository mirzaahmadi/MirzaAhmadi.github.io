        CS110110 was my first introduction to web development and 
        computer science. The course focused on HTML, CSS, and 
        JavaScript, which initially presented a challenge in the 
        lecture sessions. However, the bi-weekly practical sessions 
        provided a platform to apply the concepts and solidify my 
        understanding. Creating a personal website was an effective way 
        to consolidate the knowledge gained from the lectures and showcase 
        my skills.
       <br>
        While I enjoyed the practical sessions, I encountered 
        several difficulties, particularly in creating a 
        functional form for my website. The complexity of 
        JavaScript made it challenging, and I had to rely on 
        external resources and in-class examples to overcome 
        the hurdle.
        <br>
        Although I learned a lot during the course, I acknowledge that 
        I could have invested more effort in the practical sessions. 
        While I spent considerable time refining the usability and 
        aesthetic aspects of my website, I could have included more 
        features to enhance its professionalism.
        <br>
        Overall, I am pleased with my website and feel confident in 
        my web development skills. I look forward to advancing my 
        knowledge through future projects.
