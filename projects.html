    <header>1. SciRef!</header>
    <p class = "welcome">
	"SciRef" is a robust tool designed to streamline the creation of personalized scientific references using provided URLs. 
	Building upon the functionality of a Python script that I developed previously, this application combines React as the frontend framework 
	and Flask as the backend to offer a user-friendly interface. Within this interface, users have the flexibility to arrange scientific reference 
	components in their preferred order, select a repository, and input the URL of a scientific journal article. Upon submission, the application 
	instantly generates a customized scientific reference, ready for immediate use. Whether you're a researcher, student, or anyone in need of 
	accurately citing online scientific sources, this program simplifies the process, making it accessible and efficient.

    <header>2. Colour Chaos!</header>
    <p class = "welcome">
        "Colour Chaos!" is a colour-matching game created using the 
        Pygame library in Python. The game displays words in different colours, and the 
        player must type the correct colour of the word as quickly as possible. 
        The game includes features like a title screen with instructions, a timer 
        to track the player's completion time, a high score system, and a 
        congratulatory message for achieving a new high score. Players also have the 
        opportunity to restart the game and attempt to achieve a new high score after completing 
        each round. Overall, this game aims to test the player's ability to quickly identify 
        the colour of the displayed words and beat their previous best time to set new high scores.

    <header>2. Scientific Reference Customizer</header>
    <p class = "welcome">
        This Python script serves as a command-line tool for generating formatted 
        references to articles from PubMed. It takes a user-provided 
        PubMed URL as input and extracts key citation information, such as the 
        authors' names, article title, journal name, publication year, volume, 
        page numbers, and DOI. The script allows users to customize the order of 
        these citation components to suit their reference style preferences. 
        By leveraging web scraping with the BeautifulSoup and regular expressions 
        library, this project automates the tedious process of manually formatting 
        citations, providing users with a convenient and efficient solution 
        for generating accurate and properly formatted references for scientific 
        articles.
